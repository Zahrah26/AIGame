1. Introduction

SkySurge – AI Jump Rush is a 2D side-scroller auto-runner game developed using Java and the Swing GUI toolkit. The player (or an AI) navigates through a continuous stream of obstacles while collecting coins. The objective is to reach a specific score threshold without running out of lives.

The game explores core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, collision detection, event-driven programming, file handling, and artificial intelligence in the form of simple decision-making logic. By combining visuals, logic, sound, and interactivity, this project simulates a lightweight arcade experience in desktop Java.

Each team member contributed to different parts of the project, including game logic, AI behavior, player controls, obstacle dynamics, and documentation.The team collaborated using GitHub for version control and seamless integration of contributions.

3. Game Rules and Mechanics:

        1. The game begins in AI Mode or User Mode, depending on the player's selection.

        2. The player-controlled entity continuously runs forward (automatically).

        3. In User Mode, the spacebar is used to make the player jump. The player can jump up to three times without touching the ground.

        4. In AI Mode, the computer decides when to jump based on obstacle proximity and jump status.

        5. Players must avoid oncoming obstacles. A collision results in the loss of a life.

        6. Players begin with three lives.

        7. Players can collect coins (tokens) scattered in the level. Collecting 5 tokens grants one additional life and temporarily increases the player's size,like powerburst before regaining its original size.

        8. The game ends in a win when the player reaches a score of 2000 points.

        9. The game ends in a loss if all lives are lost before the score goal is reached.

 4. Project Structure

Folder	        Contents
/game	        Main game logic (Main.java, GamePanel.java)
/ai	            AI control logic (AIControl.java)
/model	        Core game entities (Player.java, Obstacle.java)
/utils	        Utility classes (SoundPlayer.java, Constants.java)
/assets	        Game assets (backgrounds, sprites, sound effects)
score.txt	    Stores the highest score for persistence

5. Features:

        1. Smart AI with distance-based obstacle awareness

        2. Power-up system with token collection

        3. Triple jump capability

        4. Token-based life recovery

        5. Endgame screen showing score and high score status

        6. Fullscreen immersive layout

        7. Sound feedback for all key actions (jump, win, game over)

        8. Text File for storing the highest score and then comparing with existing one to determine whether a higher score has been attained 

6. Limitations (With Suggested Solutions):

        1. No Pause or Resume Functionality

        Limitation: The game cannot be paused or resumed during play.

        Solution: Implement a KeyListener for the "P" key to toggle game pause using timer.stop() and timer.start().

        2. Single Type of Obstacle and Token

        Limitation: The game only features one obstacle sprite and one token type.

        Solution: Create subclasses of Obstacle and implement polymorphism for varied behavior (e.g., bouncing, flying).

        3. AI Does Not Perform Triple Jump

        Limitation: Although triple jump is supported, the AI currently only performs a single jump and does not chain up to three jumps in air.

        Solution: Enhance the AIControl class logic to check not only if the player is on the ground or jumping, but also how many jumps have been performed. Add a jump counter reference or expose that logic from the Player class.

7. Additional Features Implemented:

        1. UserPlayer jump logic with mid-air triple jump support

        2. Revive invisibility mechanic upon collision with an obstacle

        3. High score storage in local file (score.txt)

        4. Score-dependent win condition

        5. Sound-driven feedback cues (jump, win, death)

        6.Power-Up Animation: Visual size increase upon token collection.

        7.Full-screen mode: Game starts in maximized screen.
